# AIDA

react-vite stuff[
This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

- run `npm run server` when cd into the backend directory
- run `npm run dev` from the main aida folder and click on the link thats created to launch

- links should work and main feature is the chatting, I trained Aida to be a hippie so she should be fun to chat with

- special thanks to GreatStack for his amazing tutorials which helped me with the foundation for the project and learning how to set stuff up.
